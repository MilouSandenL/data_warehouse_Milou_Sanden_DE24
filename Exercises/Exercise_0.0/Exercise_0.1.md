## Exercise 0.1

## For these exercises, look up the credit cost for your snowflake edition, cloud provider and region for your snowflake account.

  ### a. You have a simple workload that runs daily in Snowflake. The workload uses 0.5 credits per day. Calculate the total credit usage and cost for a 30-day month.

  15?

  ### b. Your workload varies throughout the month. For the first 10 days, you use 2 credits per day. For the next 10 days, you use 1.5 credits per day, and for the last 10 days, you use 1 credit per day. Calculate the total credit usage and cost for a 30-day month.

  ### c. You have three different warehouses running workloads simultaneously. Warehouse A is of size XS, Warehouse B is of size S, and Warehouse C is of size M. Warehouse A is used for 10h/day, B is used for 2h/day and C is used for 1h/day. Calculate the total monthly cost assuming each warehouse runs for the full 30-day month.

  ### d. Your Snowflake warehouse uses auto-scaling. For the first 10 days, it operates on 2 clusters for 10 hours per day. For the next 10 days, it scales up to 3 clusters for 10 hours per day. For the last 10 days, it scales up to 4 clusters for 10 hours per day. Calculate the total monthly budget. Assume the warehouse consumes 1 credit per hour per cluster.
